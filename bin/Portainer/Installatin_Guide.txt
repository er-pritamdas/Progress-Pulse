To install using Docker Compose, download the compose file using the following curl command: 
	curl -L https://downloads.portainer.io/ce-lts/portainer-compose.yaml -o portainer-compose.yaml

Once you have created or downloaded the compose file, you can deploy it with the following command:
	docker compose -f portainer-compose.yaml up -d

Docker Compose will create the necessary resources and deploy Portainer. You can check to see whether the Portainer Server container has started by running docker ps:
	root@server:~# docker ps
	CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                        COMMAND        CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                                                                                NAMES
